<h2>MAN HAS STROKE ATTEMPTING TO SPEAK THE FRENCH LANGUAGE</h2>
<h5>Written by Pierre Laizoraclevonbontrain</h5>

<p>An American man of the name "John Frank" had a stroke on the night of January 31, 2022, when attempting to have a consversation with French tourists.</p>

<p>Frank cites the stupidly long words, obnoxious number of silent letters, and crackhead phonology for his stroke. We decided to interview the tourist he was speaking to, Heoauiysse (pronounced "ə"), about his take on why he had a stroke, "Its really bad planning on his part. If he wanted to speak ze French language he can't expect not to consistently take stroke medication and get tested for brain injuries regularly."</p>

<p>We asked French lingusist Idon Getpaedenuf as to why he had a stroke, as well as why the French language is so idiotic. He asked me if I knew anything and then insisted that he was human, which is weird, as I have never suggested otherwise. As he turns around to leave, I notice a scaly tail-looking body part coming out of his pant legs and hear a faint hiss.</p>

<p>Due to not getting answers, I decide to look furthur, and run for president of the French Republic. I follwed the advice of Heoauiysse and regularly took stroke medication before every speech. I win the election, and in the presidential building, there are puddles of weird goop all over the floor, and some weird slimy sensation in the atmosphere. I turn around and notice a weird scaly creature, he turn around and says "you don't need to wear your human disguise in here." I gasp and move my mouth to say the stupid guttural r and end up immediately on the floor having a seazure. The scaly creature moves over to me and checks my pulse, "ITS A HUMAN!" he shouts.</p>

<p>I am later taken to the hospital. When I wake up the doctor asks me what happened. I get up to start to explain him. He doesn't speak English, so I decide to tell him in French. I speak French somewhat correctly, until a start choking on my own tounge. I lose my breath and fall down, falling into a coma.</p>

<p>Fast forward three years, I wake up in a dark room. I yell out for anyone and someone comes in. He looks exactly like the scaly creature I saw when I was president. He starts approaching me and tells me "You thought you could reveal our secret? You thought you could just walk into France and expose us like that?" I try to get out of my seat, but I look down and realize I'm tied up. I try to scream for help, but nothing comes out of my mouth. I try again, nothing. I try to say "hello", "hi", and English word I can think of. No sound is being made. Surely they didn't... take away my ability to speak English, right? RIGHT? I try to say "Bonjour", I do it just fine. I look beside me and realize that my ID has changed, my name is now Pierre Laizoraclevonbontrain. And my place of birth is changed, too. It's Paris. I start to get hungry. I think about the food I usually eat and am suddenly disgusted. The only things that don't make we want to puke are baguettes and croissonts. Try one more esape. I want say word English. Need heaulpe. Heaulpe. Heaulpe. Uaïtte, neux!!! HEAULPE!!! Hauelloux. Oaux neux! Am bicauminge français. Aïmme hauoxplesse!!!</p>
