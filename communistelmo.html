    <h2>ELMO TEACHES KINDERGARTENERS ABOUT COMMUNISM</h2>
<h5>Written by Amon Gus</h5>

<p>Resident of Sesame Street Elmo Monster spreads the word of Karl Marx at a local kindergarten. He first talked about the alphabet and how to count to ten. After he took a few drinks, he started a rant about the flaws of capitalism and the benefits of communism, and quotes Vladimir Lenin.</p>
<p>Some say this comes as no surprise, he has advocated for sharing in the past, as shown in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxJI0LCbeDE">this video</a>. Cookie Monster went on FOX News to talk: "Me think he out of his mind. Me want Cookie. Me no want to share cookie. Dat communism."</p>
<p>Elmo has since campaigned to rename <i>Sesame Street</i> to the <i>Union of Soviet Socialist Streets</i>.
