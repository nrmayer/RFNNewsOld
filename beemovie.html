<h2>A RELIGION BASED ON THE BEE MOVIE STARTS IN NORTH KOREA</h2>
<h5>Written by Getsnow ʻImin</h5>

<p>A new religion, titled "Beemovieology" has recently surfaced in North Korea. As of February 1, 2022, over eleven churces have opened up, a majority in the DPRK. The religion has skyrocketed in popularity in the last six months, with over a third of the world's population adhering to it.</p>

<p>An unintended side effect of this is the decline in scientists. Many of those who study evolution, the start of the earth, and epidemiology, have quit due to an existensial crisis in realizing all their theories are disproven by the Beeble.</p>

<p>Also, in a matter of weeks, plenty of churches, mosques, and other places of worship have been completely abbandoned in favor of Beemovieology. Unfortuately, the supply of Bee Movie churches is no where near the demand, causing the few that do exist to be extremely crowded with people interested in the Beeble.</p>
