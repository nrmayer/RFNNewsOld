<h2>JOY ENSUES WHEN DREAM STANS LEARN TO TOUCH GRASS IN A RECENTLY OPENED REHABILITATION CENTER</h2>
<h5>Written by Benjamin Dover</h5>

<p>Becoming a Minecraft YouTube stan is a dangerous path. Parents watch every day as their hopes and dreams of having an intelligent child go down the drain when reading their kid's 60-tweet cancel thread. The braincells of children between the ages of 9 and 15 deteriarate, and their ability to recognize simple things such as grass, plants, and opinions dwindles. There seemed to be no hope for this plague, until a couragous man took it upon himself to help these sick individuals.</p>

<p>He founded the Rehabilitation Center for Minecraft YouTuber Stans. The program starts small, by simply looking at pictures of the outside world. When the stans retaliate, they are forced to take a deep breathe and be shown the pictures again. After a few weeks, when they are able to look at plants without it triggering fight or flight, they move on to physical therapy. Physical therapy starts by bringing them outside in the lawn, every day touching an increasing number of blades of grass, then moving on to walking on grass, touching tress, and talking to members of the opposite gender. When they are able to do this flawlessly, the hardest part of the program starts. They are shown tweets and YouTube comments of people respectfully criticizing Dream, and are excpected to react calmy and respectfully when they read them. This usually takes the longest, taking six months to be able to look at others' opinions not in disgust.</p>

<p>This man has been named a hero, going down in history as one of the best humans ever to live. Parents everywhere have cried tears of joy watching as their kids walk outside and write the words "I disagree" instead of every slur in the book.</p>
