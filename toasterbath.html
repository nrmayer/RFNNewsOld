<!--<h1>NEW STUDY SHOWS THAT BATHING WITH A PLUGGED IN TOASTER DECREASES YOUR RISK FOR CANCER</h1>
<h5>Written by Karen Tukthakids</h5>

<p>A new study released by the Laerton University of Legitimacy has shown numerous benefits to the practice, including more than a 90% decrease in the risk of cancer.</p>

<p>"When you place a plugged-in toaster in the bathtub, because of the line voltage present, the current flows as it finds a path to the ground. So, if you're in the bathtub, the current will flow in your body," explains Dr. Nautiscamm, "becuase of the current flowing in your body, your cells are a lot less likely to mutate uncontrollably, which is the leading cause of cancer." Test subjects included those from 2 to 7 years old, they would sit in the bathtub with toaster and would have their cells anylized to witness a decrease in potential mutations. A parent of one of the test subjects, Maria, recently went on our show to talk about it. "I just love how my little baby is doing good for the world, participating in such life-changing studies. He has been there for quite a long time, meaning they are working very hard to ensure the safety of the experiment. I just can't wait until he comes back."</p>

<p>While there has not been enough extensive research on the subject, some scientists suggest it may decrease your risk of COVID-19, the flu, and even the common cold.</p>
